# Aeroqual C# Cloud Developer Test

## Objectives
This test is to create a simple API that serves data from a JSON file. We would like to see what you would consider production quality code.

## Instructions
- The JSON file is `data.json`, and contains a list of people, with their names and ages.
- We would like you to create a RESTful API that allows you to create, update, delete, and get people.
- In addition, we would like to be able to search by a person's name. The input may not always be a complete name, e.g. if the input is `hat`, we expect `hat`, `hatter`, `that` etc to be returned.
- You are free to layout the project however you wish. 

## Submitting Completed Test
- Please commit your code to a private github repository, and invite both `AeroqualHayden` and `maxgruebneraeroqual` as collaborators.
- If you cannot do that for some reason, please zip the source code and email it to the recruiter.
